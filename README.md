    Detecting Handling missing data in dataset our department provided of current U.S football players. 

    In the software developing, I can divide my work to two parts. First, I build and apply the MLP called multiple layer         regression, also same as NN, to train and predict the RPE (training intensity and variety) for current U.S football player     based on their muscle soreness, fatigue, sleep, duration, acute load average, chronic load average, TSB and so on.             Recently I have two datasets f3 and f4, in the first part, I built a MLP function and test f3 for k^2 and MSE which is         test score for test sets and the error distributed, and the next part is joining the f3 and f4 and try to run with MLP.
